## About BUTTR

BUTTR is an innovative company founded by Naman Gupta that tackles one of the world's most pervasive pollution problems: cigarette butts. These discarded items are the world's most littered single-use plastic, containing microplastics that take over 10 years to decompose and pose serious threats to water bodies and ecosystems.

The company collects cigarette butts and transforms them into sustainable products through an innovative recycling process. This not only prevents harmful waste from entering landfills and waterways but also creates valuable, eco-friendly products.

"अयं बन्धुरयं नेति गणना लघुचेतसाम् । उदारचरितानां तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् ॥"
— Mahopanishad, Verse 6.72

"The distinction of 'this person is mine, this one is not' is made only by the small-minded. For those of noble character, the entire world is one family."

This central philosophy guides BUTTR's mission to protect all life forms through sustainable practices and waste reduction.
