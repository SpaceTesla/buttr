## About BUTTR

"अयं बन्धुरयं नेति गणना लघुचेतसाम् । उदारचरितानां तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् ॥"
— Mahopanishad, Verse 6.72

"The distinction of 'this person is mine, this one is not' is made only by the small-minded. For those of noble character, the entire world is one family."

The central idea upholds the value of all life, including that of humans, animals, plants and microorganisms, as well as the interdependence of these species both within and outside of our world.

About 95 trees are cut every second to make paper and paper packaging. The number of sustainable papers available in the market, especially for regular printing and packaging, is limited. Big paper manufacturers usually refuse to offer sustainable papers to clients, and even if they do, demand exorbitant prices.

Earlier, people had to pay a premium price for low-grade recycled papers. The quality, the colors, and the high prices were a problem for everyone. There was no control over prices, and people had no other option. Apart from this, the situation is worse for the packaging industry as it is hard to find affordable recycled paper.

Our papers are affordable, biodegradable, premium-quality, and tree-free. We provide 100% traceability, offer last-mile delivery, and save 15% of paper procurement costs for our valued clients.
